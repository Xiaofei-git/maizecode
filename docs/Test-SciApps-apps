Testing an app on SciApps.org
=============================

After [optimizing](Agave-SciApps.md) your Agave apps, the next step is to test the app to see whehter it is working correctly. The app can be tested using the Discovery Environment but the data transfer will be slow, given that SciApps.org is a remote system located at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Therefore, the best way to test the app is through the [Agave CyVerse SDK](https://github.com/cyverse/cyverse-sdk) directly.

To get started, modify the following job json and save it (e.g. my-job.json):
```json
{
    "jobName": "my-test-job-01",
    "softwareName": "ConvertTraitID-0.0.1",
    "requestedTime": "47:59:59",
    "archive": false,
    "inputs": {
        "trait": "agave://sciapps.org/example_data/gwas_raw/height.txt"
    },
    "parameters": {
        "header": 0,
        "sid": "Sorghum"
    }
}
```
Note that the input url (for 'trait') starting with 'agave://sciapps.org', which is critical for speeding up data transfer. You can get this url through browsing public example_data on SciApps.org with any app form, or browsing data.sciapps.org and change the url (e.g. from 'https://data.sciapps.org/example_data/gwas_raw/height.txt' to 'agave://sciapps.org/example_data/gwas_raw/height.txt'

Check the [CyVerse SDK](https://github.com/cyverse/cyverse-sdk/blob/master/docs/app-dev-first-app-job.md) for more details about the job json. Now you can use this job json to test your app, check job status, and download outputs for testing.

```sh
# Submit the job for Agave to execute. Don't forget to edit softwareName, jobName, inputs and parameters
# Here's a log from an example run
$jobs-submit -F my-job.json

# You can get more detailed outputs from any of the Agave CLI commands by adding -v to your command line to output the JSON response, and/or by adding -V which will print STDERR to your screen.
